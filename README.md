# Surfs_Up

###CHALLENGE OVERVIEW 

In this module 9 project, we explore advanced data storage and the process of retreival to produce different temperature trends in Hawaii.  The primary focus was on the months of June and December to determine if a potential ice cream and surf shop is sustainable year round. 

### RESULTS

December and June temperatures compared --

What we learned from this is that the average temperature in Oahu is 4 degrees higher on average in the summer month of June compared to December.  Although the December temps are a bit more scattered, the median temperature does remain lined up with the average.  

### SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Judging from the reasonable temperature averages throughout both June and December, this surf shop will be able to remain sustainable through both seasons.  Two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December can start with comparing the "Station" temperatures for each month.  Another weather comparison we could use is using different weather elements such as rainfall in each month and if it affects the beach population.
